# HikariWave Documentation
Voice module for `hikari`-based Discord bots

## What is HikariWave?
HikariWave is a standalone module for `hikari` (an asynchronous Discord API for building bots) that allows for developers to easily manipulate voice-related systems and logic. Much like `discord.py`, HikariWave uses `aiohttp` to communicate with Discord on the backend, while most other `hikari`-based bots use `Lavalink` as a backend, which requires a separate install.

## What are HikariWave's features?
- Doesn't require third-party installs besides `ffmpeg`
- Easy to use, asynchronous API
- Heavily type-hinted and type-safe

## How do I use HikariWave?
- Install `HikariWave` via `PyPI`: `pip install hikariwave`
- Import it into your program using `import hikariwave`
