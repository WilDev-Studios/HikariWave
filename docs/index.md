Voice module for `hikari`-based Discord bots

## What is hikari-wave?

`hikari-wave` is a standalone module for `hikari` (an asynchronous Discord API for building bots) that allows developers to easily manipulate voice-related systems and logic. Much like `discord.py`, `hikari-wave` uses `aiohttp` to communicate with Discord on the backend, while most other `hikari`-based bots use `Lavalink` as a backend, which requires a separate install.

## What are hikari-wave's features?

- Doesn't require third-party installs besides `ffmpeg`
- Easy to use, asynchronous API
- Heavily type-hinted and type-safe

## How do I use hikari-wave?

- Install `hikari-wave` via `PyPI`: `pip install hikari-wave`
- Import it into your program using `import hikariwave`
