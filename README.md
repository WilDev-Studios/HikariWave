# HikariWave
Voice module for `hikari`-based Discord bots
- Latest Version `UNRELEASED`
- Supports Python `3.10+`

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/hikariwave/badge/?version=latest&style=for-the-badge)](https://hikariwave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## What is HikariWave?
HikariWave is a standalone module for `hikari` (an asynchronous Discord API for building bots) that allows for developers to easily manipulate voice-related systems and logic. Much like `discord.py`, HikariWave uses `aiohttp` to communicate with Discord on the backend, while most other `hikari`-based bots use `Lavalink` as a backend, which requires a separate install.

## What are HikariWave's features?
- Doesn't require third-party installs besides `ffmpeg`
- Easy to use, asynchronous API
- Heavily type-hinted and type-safe

## How do I use HikariWave?
- Install `HikariWave` via `PyPI`: `pip install hikariwave`
- Import it into your program using `import hikariwave`

## Documentation
You can find our documentation [here](https://hikariwave.wildevstudios.net/).

## Getting Started
You need a basic `hikari` bot set up, like below:
```python
import hikari

bot: hikari.GatewayBot = hikari.GatewayBot(TOKEN_HERE)
bot.run()
```
This won't do anything besides sit and look pretty. The following will make the bot connect/disconnect if a user joins/leaves a voice channel:
```python
import hikari

bot: hikari.GatewayBot = hikari.GatewayBot(TOKEN_HERE)

@bot.listen(hikari.VoiceStateUpdateEvent)
async def voice_state_update(event: hikari.VoiceStateUpdateEvent) -> None:
    if event.state.user_id == bot.get_me().id: # Don't update if it's the bot, only others
        return
    
    if event.state.channel_id:
        await voice.connect(event.guild_id, event.state.channel_id)
    else:
        await voice.disconnect(event.guild_id)

bot.run()
```
